# Notes on scripts

## Ideas for scripts

* A script to provide a printout (tree) of a diff between the other machine's stock os installation and the current directory tree.
  * This will tell me every new file that has been added since the OS's installation and still exists.
  * Maybe see recon tooling in Kali to see if it already exists
